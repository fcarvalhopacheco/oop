# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

## Procedural Programming

+ We normally code as a sequence of steps:
  1. Download the data
  2. Process the data 
  3. Visualize it

The more data we have, the more functionality we might create, and the harder it is to think about as just a 
sequence of steps.

## Object-oriented Programming

+ An object is a data structure, which contains information about state and behavior.
+ For example,  an object representing a `person` can have a certain `name`, `phone number`, and`email`  associated 
with them, and behaviors like `callPerson` and `emailPerson`. 
+ Instead of thinking of `person` data separately from `person` actions, we think of them as one unit representing a 
`person`. This is called encapsulation.

  
### Classes 

+ Classes describe the possible states and behaviors that every object of a certain `type` could have.
+ For example. We can say that "every `person` will have a `name`, `phone number` and `email`, and will be able to 
+ receive "
