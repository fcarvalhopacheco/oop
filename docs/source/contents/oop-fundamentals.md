# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

## What is OOP?

### Procedural Programming

+ We normally code as a sequence of steps:
  1. Download the data
  2. Process the data 
  3. Visualize it

The more data we have, the more functionality we might create, and the harder it is to think about as just a 
sequence of steps.
