# Class Anatomy: Attributes and Methods

Let's create our own `class` and `object` with `attributes` and `methods`

## Basic class

To start a new class definition, all we need is class statement, followed by the name of the class,
followed by a colon.

```python
>>> class Customer:
        #  code inside `class` is indented
        pass    # use pass to create an "empty" class
```

Even though the above class `Customer` is empty, we can already create objects of the class by 
telling the name of the class, followed by parentheses.

```python
>>> customer1 = Customer()
>>> customer2 = Customer()
```
`customer 1` and `customer 2` are two different objects of the empty class Customer.
