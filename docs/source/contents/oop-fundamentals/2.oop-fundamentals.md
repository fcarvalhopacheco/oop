# Class Anatomy: Attributes and Methods

Let's create our own `class` and `object` with `attributes` and `methods`

## Basic class

To start a new class definition, all we need is class statement, followed by the name of the class,
followed by a colon.

```python
class Customer:
    #  code inside `class` is indented
    pass    # use pass to create an "empty" class
```

Even though the above class `Customer` is empty, we can already create objects of the class by 
telling the name of the class, followed by parentheses.

```python
customer1 = Customer()
customer2 = Customer()
```
`customer 1` and `customer 2` are two different objects of the empty class Customer.

## Adding Methods to a class

How do we define methods? By creating functions inside the class. 

```{important}
There is one exception! The special `self` argument needs to be created as the first argument for every method, possibly
followed by other arguments. 
```

Let's create a `method` called `identify` for the `Customer` class that takes `self` and `name` as parameters, and
finally print a message, when called.

```python
class Customer:
    
    def identify(self,name):
        print(" Hi, I am Customer " + name)
```

Now, let's create a new customer object, and call the method `identify` by using object-dot-method syntax and pass the
desired name, to finally get the output.

```python
customer1 = Customer()
customer1.identify("Fernando C. Pacheco")
Hi, I am Customer Fernando C. Pacheco
```

## What is `self`?

Classes are templates. Objects of a class don't yet exist when a class is being defined, but we often
need a way to refer to the data of a particular object within class definition. 

The purpose of `self` is to serve as a stand-in for the future object. 

Python takes care of `self` when `methods` are called from an object:

```python
customer1.identify("Fernando")
``` 
The above will be interpreted as: 

```python
Customer.identify(customer1, "Fernando")
```

## Add Attributes to class

Customer name should be an attribute of a customer object, instead of a parameter passed to a method.


```python
class Customer:
    # Set the `name` attribute of an object to `new_name`
    def set_name(self,new_name):
        # Create an attribute by assigning a value
        self.name = new_name      # this will create `.name` when set_name is called
```

```python
customer1 = Customer()
customer1.set_name("Fernando")      # <--- `.name` is created and set to "Fernando"

print(customer1.name)               # <--- `.name` can now be used =)
Fernando
```

Let's compare the codes 

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}  Old Version:
```python
class Customer:
    
    
    
    
    def identify(self,name):
        print(" Hi, I am Customer " + name)
```
:::
:::{grid-item-card}  New Version:
```python
class Customer:
    
    def set_name(self,new_name):
        self.name = new_name 
    
    # Use `.name` from the object it*self* 
    def identify(self):
        print(" Hi, I am Customer " + self.name)
```

::::

We removed the name parameter from the identify method, and replaced it with self-dot-name in the
printout, which uses self, to pull the name attribute from the object that called the method. 

```python
customer1 = Customer()
customer1.set_name = ("Fernando")
customer1.identify()
```
