## Instance and Class Data

+ Let's see how we can distinguish {ref}`Instance-level<contents/inheritance-and-polymorphism/1.inheritance-polymorphism.md#instance-level-data>` 
data and {ref}`Class-level<contents/inheritance-and-polymorphism/1.inheritance-polymorphism.md#class-level-data>` data.

### Instance-level data

```{thebe-button} 
```

``````{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 15

* - Instance-level Data
  - Notes
* - ````{container} thebe
    ```{code-block}
    :class: thebe 
    class Employee:
      def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
    
    emp1 = Employee("Poor Guy", 30000)
    emp2 = Employee("You my friend", 100000) 
    print(emp1.name + ': ' + str(emp1.salary))
    print(emp2.name + ': ' + str(emp2.salary))
    ```
    ````
    
  - + `name`, `salary` are instance attributes
    + `self` binds to an instance 
    
``````



### Class-level data

+ But now, we want to store some data that is shared among all the instances. 

+ For example, we can introduce a minimal salary across the entire organization. In other words,
the data should not differ among object instances.
