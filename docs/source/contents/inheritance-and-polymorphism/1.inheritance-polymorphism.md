# Instance and Class Data

+ Let's see how we can distinguish {ref}`Instance-level<contents/inheritance-and-polymorphism/1.inheritance-polymorphism.md#instance-level-data>` 
data and {ref}`Class-level<contents/inheritance-and-polymorphism/1.inheritance-polymorphism.md#class-level-data>` data.

## Instance-level data

+ The following code has `name` and `salary` as attributes, with specific values for each new instance of the class.
They are caller `instance attributes`

``````{list-table}

    ```{code-block}
    :class: thebe 
    class Employee:
      def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
    
    emp1 = Employee("Poor Guy", 30000)
    emp2 = Employee("You my friend", 100000) 
    print(emp1.name + ': ' + str(emp1.salary))
    print(emp2.name + ': ' + str(emp2.salary))
    ```
    ````
    
  - + `name`, `salary` are instance attributes
    + `self` binds to an instance 
    
``````

## Class-level data

+ But now, we want to store some data that is shared among all the instances. 

+ For example, we can introduce a minimal salary across the entire organization. In other words,
the data should not differ among object instances. So we can define `class attributes` in the 
body of `class`. That `class attribute` will serve as a `global variable` within a class.

    :class: thebe 
    class Employee:
        # Define a `class attribute`
        MIN_SALARY = 30000
        def __init__(self, name, salary):
            self.name = name
            #-------------------------#
            # Use class name to access 
            # class attribute
            #------------------------#
            if salary >= Employee.MIN_SALARY:
                self.salary = salary
            else:
                self.salary = Employee.MIN_SALARY
    
    emp1 = Employee("Poor Guy", 40000)
    emp2 = Employee("You my friend", 120000) 
    print(emp1.name + ': ' + str(emp1.MIN_SALARY))
    print(emp2.name + ': ' + str(emp2.MIN_SALARY))
    ```
    ````
    
  - + `MIN_SALARY` is shared among all instance 
    + {octicon}`alert;1em;sd-text-info` `self` is not used to define class attributes.
    + use `ClassName.ATTR_NAME` to access the `class attribute` value.
    
``````

+ The benefit of using `class attributes` is to have global constants that are related to class,
for example `min` and `max` values for attributes, or commonly used values and constants, e.g. `pi`.
